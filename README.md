# What's cardshow?

`cardshow` helps you generate q&a cards similar to those of a popular card game.

It takes questions and answers from two `.txt` files and generates two `.html` pages, which you can then print from your browser as PDF.

For best results, use Firefox. For reasons unknown to me at this time, Chrome and Edge don't seem to print correctly.

In the `Page Setup...` dialog:
* check `Shrink to fit Page Width`
* check `Print Background (colors & images)`
* set margins to 12.7mm
* make sure `Headers & Footers` are all set to `--blank--`

This code relies on:
* Milligram CSS framework
* Google Fonts
